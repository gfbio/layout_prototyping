# Layout prototyping for GFBio.org

This is the place to collect all basic layout ideas and suggestions,
which are based ob plain HTML5, CSS, javascript, etc...

## Development status

The main basis for developments is the develop-branch (quite obvious ...).
Please create new branches based on the develop-branch.

Currently the Layout prototype can be found inside the 'bootstrap_layout_mk' folder':
- 'index.html' contains the Landing-Page prototype
- 'base.html' contains the prototype for generic/main content

The "Landing-Page" prototype is almost completely independent from other parts of
the desired layout.Compare: [Landing-Page](http://c103-170.cloud.gwdg.de/gfbio_html/develop/bootstrap_layout_mk3/)

A suggestion of a basic HTML-Skeleton for generic content can be found here:
